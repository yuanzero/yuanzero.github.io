- **Quantitative Hardness Assessment with Vision-based Tactile Sensing for Fruit Classification and Grasping (2025)**

<div style="text-align: justify">
  Accurate estimation of fruit hardness is essential for automated classification and handling systems, particularly in determining fruit variety, assessing ripeness, and ensuring proper harvesting force. This study presents an innovative framework for quantitative hardness assessment utilizing vision-based tactile sensing, tailored explicitly for robotic applications in agriculture. The proposed methodology derives normal force estimation from a vision-based tactile sensor, and, based on the dynamics of this normal force, calculates the hardness. This approach offers a rapid, non-destructive evaluation through single-contact interaction. The integration of this framework into robotic systems enhances real-time adaptability of grasping forces, thereby reducing the likelihood of fruit damage. Moreover, the general applicability of this approach, through a universal criterion based on average normal force dynamics, ensures its effectiveness across a wide variety of fruit types and sizes. Extensive experimental validation conducted across different fruit types and ripeness-tracking studies demonstrates the efficacy and robustness of the framework, marking a significant advancement in the domain of automated fruit handling.

- **Digital Twin Systems for Reconfigurable Soft Robots (2023-2024)**

<div style="text-align: justify">
  In the rapidly evolving field of soft robotics, advancements in new materials, structural designs, and conceptual frameworks have propelled the rise of soft robot technology, particularly towards a highly versatile modular architecture with vast potential applications across various industries. However, one of the main challenges in this domain is the shape-morphing issue, as existing visualization and simulation tools struggle to adequately represent the complex and continuous deformation behaviors of soft robots. Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of intuitive, user-friendly platforms for visualizing and interactively controlling the shape-shifting capabilities of these robots. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative Digital Twin (DT) system specifically designed for reconfigurable soft robots, operating within an Augmented Reality (AR) environment. This system facilitates a more natural and accurate depiction of 3D soft deformations while providing an intuitive interface for simulation. We utilize a parameterized curve-driven method to dynamically adapt the DT in the AR space, ensuring smooth transitions between various 3D shape-morphing states. We identify three fundamental shape-morphing patterns—stretching, bending, and twisting—and create advanced visualization tools to precisely demonstrate these morphological changes. To enhance real-time representation of shape-morphing, we employ sensor fusion to detect and depict the soft robot's structural changes as parameterized curves. Our system is fully operational in an AR environment, empowering users to conduct immersive examinations and simulate reconfigurations of real-world soft robotic systems.

- **Data-Driven Shape Optimization Design for Auxetics Using Isogeometric Analysis (2019-2021)**

   <div style="text-align: justify">
  This project implements a back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-based design framework for petal-shaped auxetics using isogeometric analysis, and proposes a deep neural networks (DNN) framework for tetra-chiral auxetics shape optimization design. The highly nonlinear relation between the input geometry variables and the effective material properties is fitted by a data-driven method (i.e., BPNN, DNN), facilitated by the NURBS-based parametric modeling scheme with a small number of design variables. This enables an easy analytical sensitivity analysis, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency. Optimal auxetic structures are produced using 3D printing and experimentally tested for their properties. The implementation is based on the collaboration between Matlab and TensorFlow.

- **Multiple Accelerated Methods for Mesh-based and Isogeometric Topology Optimization (2018-2019)**

  <div style="text-align: justify">
  This research proposes multilevel mesh, effective iterative methods, and local-update strategies to accelerate computing efficiency in topology optimization. For mesh-based topology optimization, the method projects density from coarse to fine meshes to accelerate convergence, adopts an initial-value-based preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method to solve the equations of Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and decreases the number of updated meshes according to their density. This results in a 35%-80% reduction in computational time compared to the classical TOP88 code. For isogeometric topology optimization, where control points are the design variables, the method applies *h*-refinement to subdivide the mesh, adopts a Multigrid conjugate gradient method (MGCG) to solve the equilibrium equation, and reduces control points according to their density. This successfully reduces 37%-93% of computational time compared to unaccelerated cases. The multiple accelerated methods perform better in large-scale cases and have general applicability for topology optimizations based on either meshes or control points.
