<div style="text-align: justify">
  As a postdoctoral fellow at HKUST, my academic and research endeavors have spanned across a diverse spectrum of interdisciplinary domains within engineering and technology. At the core of my research philosophy lies a dynamic interplay between the soft and hard, encapsulating everything from sophisticated software algorithms to cutting-edge hardware. This holistic approach empowers me to forge bridges between virtual models and their physical counterparts, leveraging the potent synergy of AR/VR and IoT technologies to craft seamless integrations between digital twins and their real-world manifestations.  Moreover, at the heart of my professional journey is the human-centric concept, striving to ensure that my contributions are not only technically proficient but also genuinely beneficial and valuable to humanity. This dedication to enhancing human experiences through technology is the driving force behind my career aspirations.
  <br><br>
  Currently, my work is dedicated to leveraging embodied AI and robotics to replace strenuous manual tasks, liberating humans from monotonous, repetitive, and meaningless labor. My vision is to empower people to focus on more creative, fulfilling, and impactful pursuits, while intelligent machines take on the burdens of routine work.
